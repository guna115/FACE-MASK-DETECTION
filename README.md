# Face Mask Detection 

## Project Description

Face Mask Detection is an AI-based application that identifies whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using real-time camera input. This project uses computer vision techniques and deep learning models to detect faces and classify them into two categories: **"Mask"** and **"No Mask"**.

The main goal of this project is to ensure public safety by encouraging mask compliance in crowded places, especially during pandemics like COVID-19. It can be deployed in public areas such as malls, offices, airports, and hospitals to monitor mask-wearing in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time face detection from webcam or camera feed.
- Classifies face as **"With Mask"** or **"Without Mask"**.
- Provides visual alerts for people not wearing masks.
- Lightweight and fast, works on normal laptops too.
